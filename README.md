An image search engine utilizes Elasticsearch to store data and offers two primary functions:
1- Search: It retrieves the most similar images to a provided reference image.
2- Database search: It conducts searches based on image tags, enabling users to find images that match specific descriptors.
These functionalities involve processes such as searching, displaying results, image comparison, and feature extraction.
